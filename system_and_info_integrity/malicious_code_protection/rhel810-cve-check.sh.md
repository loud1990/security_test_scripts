# rhel810-cve-check.sh - Documentation

## Overview
This script provides an offline CVE/Fixed-version check for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.10. It uses a hard-coded database of package names, fixed versions, and associated CVE IDs. It prints a table showing installed versions and whether they are patched or vulnerable, along with any CVEs hit in the changelog.

## Prerequisites
- Tools: rpm, rpmdev-vercmp (optional), and common shell utilities (grep, awk, sed, find, date, sort, uniq, tr, paste, column, wc).
- The script is designed to run without network access (offline) and relies on the local RPM database.

## Environment and config
- The DB is defined in the script as a HEREDOC with lines in the format: package|fixed_version|cve_ids
- If rpmdev-vercmp is present, used for epoch-aware comparisons; otherwise a non-epoch comparison is used via sort -V fallback.
- The script prints a header, a tabular report, and a short legend at the end.

## Usage
- Run with default settings:
  ./system_and_info_integrity/malicious_code_protection/rhel810-cve-check.sh
- There are no command-line options in this script; to adjust behavior, modify the DB entries or environment.

## Outputs
- Prints a formatted table to stdout with columns:
  PACKAGE | INSTALLED | FIXED (>=) | STATUS | CVEs (changelog hit)
- The header lines include:
  RHEL 8.10 Offline CVE Patch Check (air-gapped)
  Date: <current date in ISO8601 seconds>
  Note: If rpmdev-vercmp is not available, a hint to install rpmdevtools is printed.
- It prints a legend at the end explaining statuses (patched, vulnerable, etc.).

## Security considerations
- Since this is an offline check using a local DB, ensure the DB is maintained securely and access to the script is restricted.
- Avoid leaking sensitive system package versions in shared logs; prefer stdout to be used for reporting and redirect logs as needed.
