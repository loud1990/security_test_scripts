#Security Test Scripts
This repo will serve as a home to some test scripts to test the security of systems. At its outset, it will focus on a RHEL 8.10 system, with potential to branch out into more systems as time goes on. These scripts will aim to test for FIPS-140-3 and DISA STIG compliance, as well as to test the overall security of the system.
